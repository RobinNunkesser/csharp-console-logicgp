# Introduction

logicGP is a generalization of the [Genetic Programming for Association Studies (GPAS)](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btm522) algorithm. It is currently unpublished, first results can be seen on published [slides](https://isd-nunkesser.github.io/slides/ISDBlackHighlyInterpretablePredictionModels.html#/logicgp).
It is intended to be used for all classification tasks. Currently, it is restricted to categorical features. 

The implementation mainly uses the following NuGet packages:

- [Italbytz.Ports.Algorithms.AI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Italbytz.Ports.Algorithms.AI) (Source: [nuget-ports-algorithms-ai](https://github.com/Italbytz/nuget-ports-algorithms-ai))
- [Italbytz.Adapters.Algorithms.AI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Italbytz.Adapters.Algorithms.AI) (Source: [nuget-adapters-algorithms-ai](https://github.com/Italbytz/nuget-adapters-algorithms-ai))

The algorithm is intended to be compatible with Microsoft's [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/ai/ml-dotnet).

## Getting started

The project features unit tests as a starting point.
